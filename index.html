              <p>
                On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the
                Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum.
                It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience
                the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
                powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are
                able to use and control wind to create power.

          <p>
            There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are
            very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
            accessible to the whole community. You can also support us by
            donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have
            some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please
            let us know by contacting our Collections Department and they will
            be able to assist you.

          <h2>Volunteer</h2>
          <p>
            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.

          <p>
            Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and
            excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well you
            could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
            You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people
            who are passionate about science and sharing it with the wider
            community.
