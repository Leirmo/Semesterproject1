The purpose of this project was to practice using the skills we have been trained in. 
This is a one-semester placement where we practice Design, HTML, CSS and WCT, among other things.

Here I have created a website called community science museum. which is supposed to be a fictional website for a museum in my city.

The site will have a target group of children between 7-15 years.
the page should be informative and attractive

the project must contain 4-6 pages.
html should be semantic.
css must follow dry principle. etc

we have been assigned text and images that we can choose and use
